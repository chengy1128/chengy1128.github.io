## The influence of a high saturated animal fat diet on the anti-tumor immune response in mice
A diet enriched in animal fat is a potential factor influencing the development of breast cancer. However, it is not clear how a high fat diet (HFD) impacts the response of the immune system on tumor progression. Therefore, we investigated how HFD contributes to immune responses around tumor cells. Trp53-deficient mouse mammary tissue was chosen as a model for mammary cancer studies. Normal BALB/c mice were transplanted with Trp53-deficient mammary epithelium. Download the Poster for more details
