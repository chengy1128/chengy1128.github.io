Recently I read a interesting article that demostrated how Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) provide a efficient method to infer unknown parameters in traditional Mass Action model. <a href="https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/70/17/6704">This paper</a> specifically focused on IGFR-1 signaling network. The grandiose context of this research aims to investigate the complex dynamic network by which targeted drugs affect multiple targets. 

The biological system studied in this research is insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling network in the MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line. The IGF system is associate with tumorigenesis and proliferation , survival and migration of tumor cells. More specifically, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) is an omnipresent multifunctional tyrosine kinase(Bartucci), which is highly related to the growth of breast cancer cells. 
A previous study of invasion of MDA-MB-231 BrCa cells disclosed that IGF-1 induced formation of cellular protrusions to serve as an impetus of the cell to pull forward during the migration(Christopoulos).  Furthermore, a dual therapies targeting this signaling network ( IGF1R, PI3K, m-TOR, and MEK) in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, were  corroborated in vitro that is possible to halt reactivation of these tyrosine kinase pathways and reduce toxicity with administration of low doses(Ayunadirah). Those pre-clinical findings encourage scientists to investigate IGF-1 signaling network in order to discover new therapeutic for breast cancer. Another motivation to build this network is that the experimental data is enormous and comprehensive. This is a prerequisite for building a trustworthy network and offers the possibility of performing experimental tests. Moreover, several clinical trials of breast cancer therapy are also based on this signaling network components, so it has great clinical applicability.
