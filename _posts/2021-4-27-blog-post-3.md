Recently I read a interesting article that demostrated how Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) provide a efficient method to infer unknown parameters in traditional Mass Action model. <a href="https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/70/17/6704">This paper</a> specifically focused on IGFR-1 signaling network. The grandiose context of this research aims to investigate the complex dynamic network by which targeted drugs affect multiple targets.
