Research experience
======

**GRADUATE RESEARCHER| DR.VSEVOLOD KATRITCH, COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY, USC| PRESENT**
  * Developing computational approaches to experimentally restrained conformational modeling with the integration of biophysical and biochemical data within the 3D structural framework.
  * Current project: Structure-based discovery of Frizzled GPCR Ligand
Apply Structure Relationship Analysis on Smoothened receptor (SMO) ligands comparing to Apo FZD4
binding sites. Based on SMO receptor and FZD4 transmembrane domain analog, docking SMO ligand library
into FZD4 through ICM. Apply Virtual SYNThon Hierarchical Enumeration Screening approach on FZD4
receptor.

**RESEARCH ASSISTANT| DR. DANIEL WOLDRING, CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, MSU|SEP2019 -JUN 2020**
  * Main Design Area: Protein Engineering, aligns in machine learning aspects of protein engineering in designing a high binding affinity protein library, evolving strong binders with high specificity using a strategic collection of small, stable protein scaffolds.
  * Project: Affibody interface mutation design(PDBID: 2b88,1h0T,1LP1,2KZI). Determine the lists of positions and amino acids that could give rise to the paratope geometries based on a gradient of site-wise diversity. (Concave, Convex, Flat)
  
**DATA SCIENTIST TRAINING WITH DR. ARJUN KRISHNAN, MSU | MAY 2019 - SEPTEMBER 2019**
* Perform genome-wide association (GWAS) analysis on computational genomics & biomedical data from Opentarget.org by Python and R.
* Use statistics & machine learning to mine data and build predictive model.
* Develop computational methods to turn big data into actionable biomedical insights.

**RESEARCH ASSISTANT WITH DR. RICHARD SCHWARTZ ,MICROBIOLOGY, MSU| MAY 2016 â€“ MAY 2019**
* Complete immunostaining (IHC), such as H&E staining, Trichrome Staining, Brdu Injection and detecting
estruses. Conduct Immunofluorescence quantitative analysis for tumor samples.
* General Surgery on Mammary gland of BALB/c Mice.
* Conduct Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Tumor tissue.
* Feed and Palpate BALB/c Mice. Provide appropriate care to all groups animal including setting up new cages indeed and monitor the weaning cages on a day basis.
* Prepare pre-use chemical solutions in laboratory. Duty of care in relation to hazardous chemicals as a reporter.
* Provide technical documentation, analyzed data, reports, presentations and protocols
