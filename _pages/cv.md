Research experience
======

**GRADUATE RESEARCHER| DR.VSEVOLOD KATRITCH, COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY, USC| PRESENT**
  * Developing computational approaches to experimentally restrained conformational modeling with the integration of biophysical and biochemical data within the 3D structural framework.
  * Current project: Structure-based discovery of Frizzled GPCR Ligand
Apply Structure Relationship Analysis on Smoothened receptor (SMO) ligands comparing to Apo FZD4
binding sites. Based on SMO receptor and FZD4 transmembrane domain analog, docking SMO ligand library
into FZD4 through ICM. Apply Virtual SYNThon Hierarchical Enumeration Screening approach on FZD4
receptor.

**RESEARCH ASSISTANT| DR. DANIEL WOLDRING, CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, MSU|SEP2019 -JUN 2020**
  * Main Design Area: Protein Engineering, aligns in machine learning aspects of protein engineering in designing a high binding affinity protein library, evolving strong binders with high specificity using a strategic collection of small, stable protein scaffolds.
  * Project: Affibody interface mutation design(PDBID: 2b88,1h0T,1LP1,2KZI). Determine the lists of positions and amino acids that could give rise to the paratope geometries based on a gradient of site-wise diversity. (Concave, Convex, Flat)
  
**DATA SCIENTIST TRAINING WITH DR. ARJUN KRISHNAN, MSU | MAY 2019 - SEPTEMBER 2019**
