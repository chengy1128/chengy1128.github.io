As a passionate and detail-oriented graduate student, I enjoy approaching complex projects with computational biology to reveal the principles that underlie biological function. I was trained with advancement of computational modeling methods with data analysis techniques to understand biological phenomena and health pattern, such as controlling, and exploiting the immune system to treat a range of diseases or reprograming of tumor cell metabolism to terminate metastasis. In the future, I hope I can solve human beingâ€™s hard-to-treat diseases, make efforts to new therapeutics, and discover or synthesis high value chemicals that can perform  advance improvement in medical care.

**Nailed the Interview!**

April 12, 2021

I'm so glad to share that I'll be joining <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/">Scripps Research Translational Institute</a> as a summer intern where I'll be exposed to current topics in translational science, especially human #genomics. So excited that I have a chance to visit gorgeous beaches in La Jolla!!
