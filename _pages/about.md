Hello there! This is Yun (say it as as "U-N")! I enjoy approaching complex projects with computational biology to reveal the principles that underlie biological function. I was trained with advancement of computational modeling methods with data analysis techniques to understand biological phenomena and health pattern, such as controlling, and exploiting the immune system to treat a range of diseases or reprograming of tumor cell metabolism to terminate metastasis. In the future, I hope I can solve human beingâ€™s hard-to-treat diseases, make efforts to new therapeutics, and discover or synthesis high value chemicals that can perform  advance improvement in medical care.
